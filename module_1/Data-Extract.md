# Raw Data Sources and Extraction Techniques

## Examples of Raw Data Sources

Raw data refers to unprocessed or uncleaned data that comes from a variety of sources such as:

- **Archives of texts and images from paper documents and PDF files**  
  _Example:_ Scanning a handwritten sheet and converting it into a text file.

- **Web pages containing text, tables, images, and links**  
  _Example:_ A forum page or a news website.

- **Analog audio and video recordings (e.g., tapes or live broadcasts)**  
  _Example:_ Recording of an interview or a live TV broadcast.

- **Survey data, statistical and economic data, and transactional data from financial/business activities or POS (Point of Sale)**  
  _Example:_ Store sales data or survey results.

- **Event data such as social media streams, weather data, and IoT (Internet of Things) device data**  
  _Example:_ Tweets or weather sensor readings.

- **Medical records such as patient history, treatments, medical images, and DNA/RNA data**  
  _Example:_ X-ray images or genetic analysis.

## Data Extraction Techniques

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):**  
  Converts texts from paper or images into machine-readable digital files.  
  _Example:_ Converting a scanned document image into editable text.

- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converters):**  
  Converts analog audio recordings into digital files.  
  _Example:_ Digitizing audio from an old tape.

- **CCDs (Charged-Coupled Devices):**  
  Capture images in digital format.  
  _Example:_ Digital camera usage.

- **Surveys and Questionnaires:**  
  Used for collecting statistical data.  
  _Example:_ Market research survey.

- **Cookies and User Logs:**  
  Track user behavior.  
  _Example:_ Logging visited web pages.

- **Web Scraping:**  
  Extracts data from websites such as text, tables, and links.  
  _Example:_ Extracting product prices from an e-commerce website.

- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):**  
  Pull data from databases or official sites.  
  _Example:_ Using a weather siteâ€™s API to get live weather data.

- **SQL and NoSQL:**  
  Query languages for structured and unstructured databases.  
  _Example:_ Extracting sales data from a store database.

- **Edge Computing:**  
  Processes data at the source to reduce the amount of transferred data.  
  _Example:_ A smart camera analyzing motion instead of sending full video.

- **Biomedical Devices:**  
  Devices like microfluidic arrays used for DNA sequencing.  
  _Example:_ DNA testing device.

## Use Case Examples with Data Sources and Extraction Techniques

- **Using APIs to collect structured data from multiple sources into a central warehouse.**  
  _Example:_ Aggregating sales data from multiple e-commerce stores.

- **Using APIs to capture periodic or real-time events and store them in an archive.**  
  _Example:_ Tracking tweets or social media posts.

- **Using Edge Computing in IoT devices to reduce data volume by extracting only key features.**  
  _Example:_ Smart camera analyzing video instead of transmitting the full footage.

- **Storing data in its raw format for later analysis.**  
  _Example:_ Saving surveillance camera recordings.

- **Using medical devices and diagnostic images to extract data for healthcare purposes.**  
  _Example:_ Analyzing X-rays or blood tests.
